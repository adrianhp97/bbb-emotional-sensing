 * This class caches the information about the content types on the H5P Hub.

 * as it only caches the data (and converts it to a local format). It DOES NOT add information
 * about locally installed libraries and user rights. ContentTypeInformationRepository is meant to do this.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Get the content type information by calling get().
 * - The method updateIfNecessary() should be called regularly, e.g. through a cron-job.
 * - Use contentTypeCacheRefreshInterval in the H5PEditorConfig object to set how often
 *   the update should be performed. You can also use forceUpdate() if you want to bypass the
 *   interval.
